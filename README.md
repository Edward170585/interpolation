interpolation
=============

 * This work is about cubic spline interpolation algorithms. In order to make 
   life easier, I am going to code these algorithms step by step. However, you 
   must read the references that I mention below .
 * For general understanding please refer to the Wikia page
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation
 * To understand the program, please refer to
   http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~restrepo/475A/Notes/sourcea-/node35.html
 * And you should not ignore the book:
	Numerical Recipes in c: The Art of Scientific Computing by
	William H. Press,
	Brian P. Flannery,
	Saul a. Teukolsky, and
	William T. Vetterling .
	Copyright 1988 (and 1992 for the 2nd edition)
